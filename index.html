<h2>My background:</h2>
<p>I'm a software developer who works on full-stack projects but I enjoy back-end work the most. I currently work at Paycom and I am creating this page to catalogue the projects I create on the side! The technologies I'm most comfortable with are PHP, Java, HTML, JS, and SQL, but I hope to expand that as I complete more projects.</p>
<h2>My projects:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        This website!
        <ul>
            <li>
                This will have a list of projects that I complete over time as I try to improve my skills.
            </li>
            <li>
